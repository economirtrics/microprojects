    "Wikipedia is an ad-free, open source, and very reliable source of information about almost every topic you can imagine!  In this MicroProject, you will explore how to easily import data from any Wikipedia tables into a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wikipedia article \"List of mountains by elevation\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_by_elevation) contains information on hundreds of mountains -- including **Mount Everest** (tallest in the world), **Denali / Mount McKinley** (tallest in the United States), and hundreds more!\n",
    "- Click the Wikipedia link above to view how the Wikipedia page looks in your web browser before we begin to work with it in Python!\n",

    "## Part 1: Fetching Data From Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "The Wikipedia article \"List of mountains by elevation\" is organized into several tables of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One table for mountains that are at least 8,000m in height,\n",
    "- Another table for 7,000m mountains  (7,000m - 7,999m),\n",
    "- Another table for 6,000m mountains  (6,000m - 6,999m),\n",
    "- ...and so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "The `pd.read_html(...)` function in the pandas library is designed to **read data from tables found in webpages**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1.1: Using `pd.read_html`\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell, we'll use `pd.read_html(...)` to read all of the tables from the Wikipedia page  \"List of mountains by elevation\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mountains_by_elevation).  Here's a brief overview of the `pd.read_html` function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `read_html` function is **very similar** to the commonly used `read_csv`.\n",
    "- Instead of returning a DataFrame from a CSV file, the `read_html` returns **one DataFrame for each table on the website** as a Python list of DataFrames.  *(This means we'll have 8 different DataFrames when there are eight different tables on the Wikipedia page.*)\n",
    "- Just like `read_csv`, you only need to provide the URL of the data or an HTML file that you've downloaded! 🎉\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using an HTML file vs. Using of a URL\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, many sites could be easily and automatically downloaded with Python and you can use the URL inside of `pd.read_html`.  However, with the growth of AI agents scraping websites, many sites (including Wikipedia) are adding security to prevent automatic \"scraping\" of data.  This prevents us from having Python directly download the website and extract the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use data from a site, you can save a copy of the webpage as an HTML file.  We have done that for the Wikipedia page and provided it for you as part of this MicroProject.  The file name is `List of mountains by elevation - Wikipedia.html`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, load the HTML page using the filename above and fetch a list of DataFrames.  Each DataFrame is a table from the Wikipedia page \"List of mountains by elevation\" and you will store those in the Python variable `dfList`:"
